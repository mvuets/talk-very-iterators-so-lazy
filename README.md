An iterator is a neat concept to hide complexities of accessing a data
collection behind a simple interface. Moreover it enables one to
benefit from lazy evaluation, modular code design, and code-as-data.

In this talk I want to refresh your memory on Perl built-in iterators
and closures. Then take an iterator-less example of code and
step-by-step bring it to an iterator-ful shape.

Don't be backed off by all the buzz words---I'll have kittens!
